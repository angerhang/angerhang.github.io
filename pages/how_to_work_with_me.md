I am based at the Big Data Institute (BDI), Oxford and the Nuffield Department of Population Health. Our group offers 
sporadic summer internship positions via UNIQ+ or the BDI internship scheme. For longer-term projects, we could also 
supervise master thesis projects both internally from the NDPH global health MSC program or if you can secure your own
funding from your own university. For instance, places like EPFL/ETHz could offer some funding to do your master thesis elsewhere. 

If in doubt, feel free to email me at hang.yuan@ndph.ox.ac.uk with a copy of your CV and a few sentences about your past experience
and research interests :D
