I develop machine learning methods that learn meaningful representations from wearable biosignals to understand human behaviour and improve human health at scale. My work focuses on three levels of <span style="color: #0080ff;">representation learning of human behaviour</span>: 

* <span style="color: #0080ff;">Low-level movement representations</span> that generalise across activities and populations, 
* <span style="color: #0080ff;">High-level behavioural representations</span> that compress long-term wearable time series for biological and genomic discovery, and 
* <span style="color: #0080ff;">Multi-modal health representations</span> that integrate biosignals with genetic and physiological data to quantify health along a continuum. 

Using self-supervised and data-driven approaches, I build foundation models for wearable data that reduce reliance on labels while improving robustness and real-world applicability. My goal is to turn continuous human sensing into a scalable, interpretable foundation for preventive and precision health.

I daydream of a future where wearable sensing and genetic data can be used to personalise individual treatment plans for all.

My doctoral research was supervised by [Aiden Doherty](https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/team/aiden-doherty) and [Simon Kyle](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/simon-kyle), which has been generously sponsored by Novo Nordisk. I also worked with [Andrew Zisserman](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/) and [Timor Kadir](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~timork/) for my rotation project.
Previously I worked with [Herbert Jaeger](http://minds.jacobs-university.de/herbert/) and [Benn Godde](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ben_Godde) on echo state neural networks for my undergraduate thesis. My master's thesis was supervised by [François Fleuret](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/) and [Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/mathieu.salzmann).


I enjoy playing tennis and bounldering outside of work. At times, I also join the other side and use my organic intelligence to augment aritificial intellgience at startups like [Lume Health](https://www.lumehealth.io).

Finally, I am always looking forward motivated students to do projects with me. If you would like to study with me, feel free to email me with your interests, CV and code sample with a subject headline *[apple]*.
