I am an NDPH Early Career Research Fellow at the Nuffield Department of Population Health at Oxford. My primary research interest is to understand how can wearables improve human health. Wearable devices can provide *longitudinal 
passive monitoring* of human behavior and physiology. Few other technologies can match wearable data in its length at the same 
level of temporal granularity. As the measurement tools improve and longer data become available, we are blessed with this gold mine that contains a huge amount of under-exploited data which could *transform our understanding of human physiology and improve human health*.  

Main research interests: 
- How to best represent human sensing time series data using machine learning? 
- The association between device-measured behavior and human diseases.
- How to use wearable with omics data for genomics discovery and risk prediction? 


 My doctoral research is supervised by [Aiden Doherty](https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/team/aiden-doherty) and [Simon Kyle](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/simon-kyle), which has been generously sponsored by the Li Kai Shing Foundation and Novo Nordisk. I also worked with [Andrew Zisserman](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/) and [Timor Kadir](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~timork/) for my rotation project.
Previously I worked with [Herbert Jaeger](http://minds.jacobs-university.de/herbert/) and [Benn Godde](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ben_Godde) on echo state neural networks for my undergraduate thesis. My master's thesis was supervised by [François Fleuret](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/) and [Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/mathieu.salzmann).
