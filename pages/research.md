50% of my research is on machine learning and the other 50% lies in its applications in health. Currently, my primary work is focused around semi-supervised learning for wearables. My doctoral research is supervised by Prof. [Aiden Doherty](https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/team/aiden-doherty) and Prof. [Simon Kyle](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/simon-kyle). My research has also been generously sponsored by the Li Kai Shing foundation.

Back at Jacobs, I first worked with Prof. [Michael Kohlhase](https://kwarc.info/people/mkohlhase/) and then my real ML research started with Prof. [Herbert Jaeger](http://minds.jacobs-university.de/herbert/) and Prof. [Benn Godde](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ben_Godde). 
I also spent time at MPI with Prof. [Grosse-Wentrup](https://ni.cs.univie.ac.at) and at EPFL with Prof. [Courtine](https://courtine-lab.epfl.ch) on brain-computer-interface research which was super interesting. My master thesis supervisors are Dr. [François Fleuret](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/) and Dr. [Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/mathieu.salzmann).


### Machine learning

| ![Delayed Attack Samples](/assets/images/da_sample.jpg) [PDF](/assets/files/hang_thesis.pdf) |  **2019 Jun: A Primer on the Delayed Adversarial Attack in Using Recurrent Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning** <br/><br/> An introduction of a series of work on delayed adversarial attack in deep learning. We will make the code available soon.|
| ![Breakout](/assets/images/atari.jpg) [Repo](https://github.com/angerhang/reinforcement-learning-cheat-sheet) |  **2019 Feb: Reinforcement Learning Cheat Sheats** <br/><br/> A collection of theories and applications of reinforcement learning as part of my master thesis. | 
| ![Echo State Network](/assets/images/esn.png) [Repo](https://github.com/angerhang/thesis) [PDF](/assets/files/thesis.pdf) |  **2017 Jun: Motor Learning Skill Classification Using Echo State Networks** <br/><br/> ESNs are a type of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that are easy to train but still maintain the power of capturing the temporal information that do. In my bachelor thesis, I constructed ESNs for motor learning skill classification on EEG data. Additionally, I also developed new methods on how to increase the interpabiltiy of ESNs.  | 


### Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)

| ![sTeX](/assets/images/mmt.png) [PDF](/assets/files/cicm_2016.pdf) |  **2016 Jun: Mixing Surface Languages for OMDoc** <br/><br/> The formalism of mathmatics: MathML, OpenMath and OMDoc are machine-friendly formats for math so that the machines can do search, automated proving and cross-referencing easily. TeX is the main driving horse for high quality mathematics documents authoring. A variant of TeX that allows for structural formats, enables us to transform those documents into OMDoc with the help of LaTeXML sTeX plugin to let machines operate on the documents. |
