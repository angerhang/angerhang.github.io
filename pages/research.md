50% of my research is on machine learning and the other 50% lies in its applications in health. Currently, my primary work is focused around semi-supervised learning for wearables. My doctoral research is supervised by Prof. [Aiden Doherty](https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/team/aiden-doherty) and Prof. [Simon Kyle](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/simon-kyle). My research has also been generously sponsored by the Li Kai Shing foundation.

Back at Jacobs, I first worked with Prof. [Michael Kohlhase](https://kwarc.info/people/mkohlhase/) and then my real ML research started with Prof. [Herbert Jaeger](http://minds.jacobs-university.de/herbert/) and Prof. [Benn Godde](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ben_Godde). 
I also spent time at MPI with Prof. [Grosse-Wentrup](https://ni.cs.univie.ac.at) and at EPFL with Prof. [Courtine](https://courtine-lab.epfl.ch) on brain-computer-interface research which was super interesting. My master thesis supervisors are Dr. [François Fleuret](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/) and Dr. [Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/mathieu.salzmann).
