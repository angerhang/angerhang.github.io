It has been a while since I last wrote an essay. COVID has changed many people's lives and that include mine. Recently, I came to an old blog post, [Cities and Ambition](http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html), which talks about how big cities like New York and London send different messages to their people. This blog post went on talking about for ambitious people, it is good to live in a city that sends the right message. I thought this was refreshing. After studied neurosceince, I have always believed that people have much less free will than we think we do. That's why, I have tried changing most envrionment factors that might have a negative impact on my work. However, my focus has only remained on the micro-level. Paul Graham's (PG) essay pushes me to rethink how city could also have a big role to play in our career.  

In PG's term, different cities send different messages. Boston has a message that people should be intelltual; Paris has a message that people should care about art; and New York simply tells people that they need to be richer. I guess we can also use other words like the "vibe" or "feeling" of a city to describe the message of a city. But you get what he means.  


------------------------------


There is this one city that I want to talk about and that's Shenzhen, China. I have only visited this city a few times but it's always given me a long-lasting impression. I think the message that Shenzhen has is about hard work. There are few cities out there growing at its phase and with its size. People from Western countries are more or less familiar with the traditional powerhouses like New York, Paris or Berlin, but people's conception about Shenzhen is lacking because it is a new city so new to a point where most of its residents didn't grow up in Shenzhen.







Often, when we live in one place for too long, we lose sight of what is special of the place as we have taken things for granted. As grateful as one can be, we typically fail to appreciate the value of something until we lose it. That's part of the story why going on trip can bring us new perspectives. But main point that I want to make is that, I think the message of city can also change as you spend more time living there. The first time that I came to Oxford, when I was walking through the streets of this historical city and admiring how many great discoverings are uncovered behind the walls of the colleges. However, I didn't feel like that I belong seeing people wearing Harry Potter like college gown on top of tailor suits or dresses. 


I still feel humbled daily studying here but the message Oxford sends went from you don't belong here to you just have to study very hard.




During my upbringing, I have lived/visited many great cities of modern day. Ironically, the more places that I've been to, the less certain that I feel about the best place to live for me. I grew up in a mid-sized metropolitican city, Guiyang, in China. Despite Guiyang being a relatively under-developed capital city, its people look for comfort and joy in life. When you walk on the street even today, you can quite easily notice that people walk at a much slower phase than cities like Hong Kong or Shanghai. People are just happy living their lives. Nothing more, nothing less. It is great for living but getting complaisant too early is dangerous for the young.

If all things go well, I will finish my PhD by the end of next year and I will very likely pick a new city to live in. That's why I will use the opportunity to think of my options. I hope by me writing down my thought process, others may or may not gain new perspectives about the envrionment that they want to live in. I love small towns, Oxford and Cambridge alike that are very much self-contained but not too far away from big cities, London in this case. By being here, you are often reminded of the great minds and and the intellectuals who have studies behind these walls.
